# ERC-7

Weights and Config found on https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/TensorFlow-Object-Detection-API
coco.names was found on https://opencv-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yolo/yolo.html
but is also just available on https://opencv.org/introduction-to-the-coco-dataset/

Glitch effects used: https://github.com/makeworld-the-better-one/live-glitch

also the token for the discord bot is left on here, but it has limited permissions on my server

the file paths on ERC7.py (218-220) are still set to whatever is on my computer and you'll need to change it to each file respectively in model for it to work
